Explanation:
Imports: The code imports necessary modules: datetime for handling date and time, json for parsing JSON data, and urllib.request for making HTTP requests.
url_builder Function: This function constructs the URL needed to query the OpenWeatherMap API using the provided latitude and longitude.
fetch_data Function: This function takes the constructed URL, makes a request to the API, reads the response, and converts it from JSON format to a Python dictionary.
time_converter Function: This function converts a Unix timestamp into a human-readable date and time format.
Coordinates: The latitude and longitude for Belfast, UK are defined.
Fetching Data: The fetch_data function is called with the URL generated by url_builder, and the resulting JSON data is stored in json_data.
Extracting Data: Relevant pieces of information (city name, temperature, timestamp, weather description, and sunset time) are extracted from the JSON data.
Output: The extracted information is printed in a readable format.
